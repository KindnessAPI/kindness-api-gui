I believe writing down our feelings and emotions can help people to understand the situation better and have more awareness on the situation and start to be able to process the tangled issues by realising where the knot is and untangle them smoothly with grace and ease.

How did I got myself into and out of depression is a book that i can write about.

When I choose to be productive, my mood changes to a happier state because of solution thinking.

Living encouragement sounds really cool to me.

With my finite time, I can still give birth to the infinite love with the tech talent I share for kindness.

Only I can cancel my dreams, so I protect my passion. And surprise my near and dear with success.

Anything that can be practiced is awesome to have. it's portable. it goes with you anywhere you go. You won’t lose it as long as you love it and practice it. Practice assure yourself that you are capable.

Practice makes permanence. - @ladygaga

I become a portal of my vision when I practice coding and code what I dreamed to exist

Living everyday with intention and goals is like living everyday with success because I feel good when I made progress. ❤️

My progress of finishing feature drives me to code more.

I love making new inventions with code.

When I quit drama, I quit my depression and mania depression.

When I hate I suffers from my self-created nightmare.

When I choose love over pride, I apologise and I recover.


When I choose to cry to choose to feel what should be expressed.

When I start to understand why success and fame is isolating, I start to realise that i need to prepare my friendships for adapting success and fame by helping my friends to be successful together all along the way.

It turns out choosing to help others is choosing and learning how to love again.

The biggest lie me and my friends ever told each other is that we cannot find new friends again.

Words runs within my brain like a computer software. I wasn’t aware of this and consumed a lot of toxic information from repeating the hurt and got myself a depression. But most importantly no shame in not understanding how life works.

To stop repeating the hurt, I get busy. It works for awhile. But when I apologise, the tangled knot in my heart vanishes, don't even need to smooth it to untangle it..

Bad attitude hurts myself more than I wish to get justice by repeating the hurt.

There’s a point in my life that I figured out myself was the grumpy guy in the Christmas Carol.

Without being honest about my journey, I cannot convey anything meaningful with theoretical truths.

When I choose to avoid anything, I made a void between myself and the people around me. That’s how I got myself into the solitary confinement.

When I choose love, by apologizing and changing behaviour. I heal instantly.

When I apologise to myself by saying sorry that i choose to repeating the hurt forever, I killed the happy life I always wanted. Then I wake the hell up.

When I replay happy videos in my computer, I choose to forgive.

When I declare to not hurt back anymore, because hurt back is the madness itself, inner peace starts to emerge.

When I realise how shitty over sugar drink is, I stopped consuming it.

When I realised I haven’t been truthfully personal to my audience, I rewrite my content. - @wonglok

The easy way is to listen and to search mental health solution on the internet. I need to listen a few times if I don't understand how does it work and how should i rethink, the hard way I did was to to try the depression again.

Self-help is being attacked with labels.

If I want others to help me, I must help myself first.

Before having the knowingness of “I can get through this”. When I encounter a problem in programming, I panic. But with enough practice, I have the confidence that I can solve this eventually, even I have no idea to solve things. The way I practice positivity is to write down positive aphorisms and make encouragement videos.

By helping others with computer stuff, I start to feel the love again.

I need to remind myself my last minute is now. No more “do it later. haha”

When I was 23, I overestimate my ability to withstand the toxicity in arguing. I binge watched drama TV and then I became very toxic without even knowing I was also the toxic ones in the world. To get out of it, I focus my time in practicing coding. My life changed after 5-6 years of practice.

When I give myself excuses for my misbehaviour, I get to stay stuck in life. I read the online self help material and I win my relationship back, my happiness back, my-dream-self back and also my future back.

Self-expression is my freedom. Self expression is music and art. Self expression is invention. Self expression is writing myself out so that i can see more clear.

Being happy again takes break-ups to bad behaviours - yourself, near and dear and others.

Protection and Kindness happens when there’s a power of the situation in the form of presence of mutual friendship.

Blame doesn't give myself bling bling happiness of friendship. But still struggling with those words in my mind when I’m angry.

Don’t let the dilemma question u, question the dilemma instead. - regis and @wonglok831

Giving up to me feels like a release of pain, but is actually ignoring the pain.

Giving up to me looks like I was looking for an alternative solution but it is really compromising my vision.

Giving up to me feels like risk management but we're actually talking ourselves out.

Giving up to me feels like taking a rest and get it back later but didn't go back anymore.

Giving up to me looks like I cannot imagine the next step or I don’t want to do the next step.

Giving up to me looks like damage control, but it is building a wall that keeps me away from my dreams.

Giving up to me feels like a way out but it stepping into a swamp of inactivity, stuck with depression.

Giving up to me is like elaborating fear and worry that's why I don't have imagination for thinking the steps to achieve the goal, and then say I don't have steps anymore so then I give up.

When I silence my self-judgement, I can live normal again.

When I learning life lessons the hard way, it has a lot of pain, but at least I can remember it.

I love the word something. Come together and make something that everybody says it's something.

My practiced talent and invention are the infinite and portable source of wealth to be shared.

My initial goal in my life is to do as much as Joy restoration because I found the antidote to digest my own pain and to heal my suffering, my mom's suffering and my family suffering.

I believe that Well elaboration of love in the form of writings can help people learn how to love, when they see a person’s personal experience on growth.

Verbally Give Thanks to your family member frequently. Say thank you to a cup of water that your mother gave you. She cares about your kidney, your health.

The undeniable “something” is what invention and innovation is. - @wnglok831

Not so legit, but kinda works, this is something. It encourages to innovate.

The essential part is that when I give and my other friends give, there would be a loving atmosphere and environment that people treasure. That's how trust is being built. #wecouldwecould

My words comes from my experiences.

The hardest thing I’ve ever dealt with is that hurt back with meaner words in my mind. It’s never about an eye to an eye, vice should not go versa.

What I practice with and for my mind, goes portable with myself, like coding skill and hugs.

I do something or make something for the sake of the existence of the invention.

Being myself is hard to do in this world because there are so much judgement, even to innovation and inventions in software.

Being myself equals to work anytime I want, with who I want, at where I want, with my own drum beat of pace and speed.

When I was laughing at the commitment in written words for a relationship before, I wasn’t aware the constitution of nations are also written words.

Human minds are very very made for innovation, we came from stone age to wifi music age.

I believe that human are meant to live in prosperity and happiness with ok-level of wealth in heart and pocket.

Bryant McGill’s chosen innocence idea reflects that you decide to be kind to the unkind by being the change you want first.

Coding skill breakthrough is one of my biggest motivational momentum.

Negative Assumption is deadly and destructive to my mental health.

Make things for myself is the best way to invent and innovate.

Un-revenge is letting go.

I really need to highlight my miracles, myself and your life events that I overcame and celebrate the present moment by giving tribute to all good people and things that i have.

My secret to self-learning is to learn what you think is easy and then build up confidence to learn more things that you find interesting. Repeat.

The ability to make something exist out of the void is what human beings are powerfully capable at. The question to myself is do I bring love or hurt to others while I was hurting.

I invent simply because I want to have nice things.

I make nice things for myself and share it with my friends.

Making nice things is a way to self-express.

Making nice things is a way to self-express.

Making nice things is a way to enjoy life.

Making nice things creates purpose.

My love for imagination encourage me to create nice things.

Nice things are nice to make, not just purchase.

Nice things are meant to be created not consumed.

Nice things are meant to be co-created, not exclusively sold.

Nice things are meant to be fun expression of creativity

Nice things co-exists, they don’t have to and not suppose to compete.

Flowers are nice to have. Flowers cross pollinate to innovate new colors.

Flowers don’t possess their pollin. They make them and share them with others.

Making nice things is meant to create a purpose that is bigger than yourself.

Making nice things is a way to escape poverty

Making nice things is practicing the way you create

My existence is nice enough for myself. Thus, I’m complete.

When I realise what I perceive wasn't 100% the total truth, I start to realise the hurt I perceive wasn't that big. Delusion of did they don't like me? did I misbehaved? oh no, it must be this or that.... and then spiral down into BS of self-destruction. It's dysfunctional.

Truthful and simple things are compatible.

Love build up, Fear steals kills and destroys

I really like to create wonders.

When I was so little, I make arts and crafts and electric toys from battery and electric lines.

Self-disbelieve is rooted in the need for impressions, proofing our ability is a welcomed way to not be ourselves. #resume

I believe it’s a balanced act of strategic disengagement and reserving a seat at the table with character growth.

We need to understand science more as a proof of the marvel and miracle of life, so that people would honour their health and mental wellness.

Highlight your miracle, you and your life.

My secret to self-learning is to learn what you think is easy and then build up confidence to learn more things that you find interesting. Repeat.

I invest my time and energy in something that is worth building, my mental health, character and ability to earn money. Politicians are not going to heal my depression and feed me.

Not getting caught up is one of the hardest and the best lesson I’ve learned.

Inventions and innovation are assembled abstracts of forms and essence we learn from different "simple things" in life.

To me, self-awareness is like the your-future-dream-self using time machine to travel back to present to encourage yourself.

When I code, I think computing is mostly about organisation of consideration and thoughtfulness into truthful places instead of the unimagined falsity.

I guess if we make the world a friendly personal food party with win win concept with as many people as we consider, we can prosper.

I think boundaries is essentially a steam outlet so that we don’t meltdown into madness and slime with the unconscious mind.

Invention and New Forms of ideas are bringing elementary essence together in a view or a perspective, as simple as learning from simple things in life.

The way we separate and reconnect different essence and forms back together is the beginning of enigma of what is and what could be. creativity is simple.

Does alphabet has story behind each alphabet?

Protect the integrity and fullness of your vision, Jenni said that don't profit purpose. Bryant mentioned that day to day action is our purpose. if day to day action is profit we would forget our original idea and want the by product, which is a total loss of loyalty to our dream and settle for the falsity and dwell into depression.

A form is a vessel. Essence is like water in a vessel. Without a form it's hard to convey essence of things. Water has no shape. A form is a structure of hosting essence in an organised manner.

To me, appreciate a piece of creation is simply drinking the water inside the vessel so that we don’t have to hold it with hands and it doesn’t leak.

To me, imagination is like a powerful time machine that lets us experience what is possible in forward motion. I need to remind myself that never use my imagination to destroy relationships without even knowing it. Don't imagine the unimaginable negative things about close people.

Drama is dopamine related toxicity. It is a mental-health-biohazard spreading through all human connections such as social, media, friend to friend.

Thoughtfulness and Considerations are truthful and caring inventions. Don't let falsity (a lie that has no love in it) wreck any of what's real.

Lie wrecks and twists. Sometimes we lie, and lie to ourselves that it can protect ourselves

While form is for viewing an abstract with a common sense. Essence is beyond simplicity without artificial extraction.

Complaining take away solution thinking and power of resolution from us all. Complaining and Hurting back is an indication of us being infected with mind-zombie-virus.

Forgiveness by being a bigger person, ultimately heals us from mind-zombie-virus. It breaks the chain of slavery of hatred and self harm such as PTSD mixed with anxiety through stopping the endless replay of their transgression.

Be a bigger person is the way to heal the hurt because they are unconsciously hurting others.

Forgiveness and fix our mental health first is the biggest way to help heal others. even it looks like selfishness to critical people like myself before.

My personal and truthful experience on Bryant's sentence: Success can be like building an empty castle, when all you really needed was a true home for your heart. - Bryant McGill

It's the abundance of total intelligence of myself that helped me figure out a way to forgive. And it's that pride of sitting on a high horse tire me back to unforgiveness, which eat up my love and happiness.

 I don't need to become another mental zombie with negativity as oxygen and dwelling in negativity. I can only do silence but with healing information with compassion that they will heal on their own eventually and should not be contempt because of anger and vengeance.

I reject artificial fear.

ignorance, rooted in certainty, creates misinformed judgements. - @bryantmcgill

I dream that when cliche becomes classic, cheesy inspiration becomes values, that's when we can have a more loving community.

In retrospect, I was and still need to become a developer of my life. Imagine a new life feature, turn down the noise, imagine the possible, not the unimaginable destructive force.

Brushes with your darkness won’t help you create. - @ladygaga

I invent for the sake of having something nice and be happy with the creation and the process, as well as enjoying the appreciation while we're helping out people and they are happy too. If we got income that's nice. If we got less income, i’ll adapt that. I don’t want to rely happiness on endless buying.

I try again for like 10000 times for re-writing bad programming. That’s why I can code faster and better now.

Not getting caught up and try again forever are the two hardest things to achieve but it essentially is illustrate what it looks like to never give up.

I regard Virtuous and life-loving practitioners as walking aphorisms.

Near and dear wants you to become secured in occupation but doing the same thing again and again won’t help you to innovate.

Identity is reflected by everyday actions.

Power of the situation. Do rome in rome. Be kind at BeRoyal.com

I used to be getting by with each person, so there’s not much connection with each other. Get by is just faking agreement politely but could be even having grudges and resentment.

If you can't handle the truth, you get the lie. - @jenni

Lie may be comforting at the beginning but it ultimately lock people in different cells of fake-agreement-separation and make people feel alone because they cannot have a genuine conversation with everyone after a long time of being fake to avoid conflict.

When people are agitated they criticize everything.

Cooperative with our biology is somehow powerfully productive. When I feel like work on my dream invention, I work my ass off.

Two flowers looks alike but never identical. So are your dreams and dream plans. Do success for yourself, not for others approval. I dont want my another dream to windup become like a resume.

Be thoughtful truthful simple and lead with love and beauty in humanity. Science is an enlightenment movement initially that is about finding what is true.

When I flow when I code, I let truth blossom.

What I've learned from Bryant and Jenni's broadcast is to sacrifice to be compassionate to the person who take advantage of us so we don’t have a hard heart. Maybe they needed the advantage because they are in small minded cage. i.e.) we can be a bigger person to them win. Maybe they never had anything nice in life before.

Most important lesson I learned from my previous experience is that I should not get caught up in any sense or way. If I get caught up, I would have this stagnation of bitterness and dysfunction and eventually dis-appoint ourselves from our dream.

Having a hard heart or having a very strong sense of fear is like a cage, thinking the world is unsafe so you gotta play it safe play, play it nice, please people, then I wind up being small and powerless, depressed and defeated.

It's like paid for a lesson about this person early not after 9 years of friendship. It's like your friendship is so worthy like a gazillion but they took the friendship to sold for a small thingy.
