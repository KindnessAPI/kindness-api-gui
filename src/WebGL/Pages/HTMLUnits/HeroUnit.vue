        Making Kindness Louder at Scale
      </div>
      <div class="px-3 text-lg mb-2">
        At this age, a lot of people are depressed and grieving because they lost their loved ones to Co-VID-19 or they lost their job or business. People need kindness and love from each other, and encouargement from Christ community as well.

        Why do we make KindessAPI, when there's social media?
      </div>
      <div class="px-3 text-lg mb-2">
        It's easy to encourage others on social media, but the amount of audience of Kindness essential message is quite low due to attention fatigue with the excessive amount of content in social media feed.
        API is a good way to spread kindness because it doesn't have ads or unrelated content and the Kindness content can be integrated to other websites or apps.
